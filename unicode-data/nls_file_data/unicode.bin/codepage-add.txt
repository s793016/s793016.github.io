Dear Witch Five:

有關於 Unicode.bin 表格3與4，00h與02h的問題，因為我自己也是一樣找不出它
的規則所在，所以只好厚臉皮詢問那份文件的原作者囉。但還蠻幸運的，不過因為
之前沒做過這方面的研究，所以不太懂，看樣子有點複雜就是了，我將信轉給您，
有任何問題了話再來討論吧！希望這會對您有所幫助。 ^_^

Subject: Some questions about UNICODE.BIN file format

Dear Geoff Chappell:

Hello, nice to meet you.

I come from Taiwan, and I'm trying to fix Traditional Chinese(BIG5,
Codepage 950) <-> Unicode Conversion Map to the correct section on
Microsoft Windows 9x system.

Fortunately, after reading your article "Code Pages and the Windows 95
IFSMGR", I am going to finish the work! But, I met some questions when I
read your article about "UNICODE.BIN File Format"...

The UNICODE.BIN have four tables, but I don't understand that the "Table
3. Range Definition for Conversion from Unicode " and "Table 4. Range
Definition for Conversion to Unicode "'s fields mean.

----
00h offset from start of table to definition for a lower range; or zero
02h offset from start of table to definition for a higher range; or zero
----

If I write "zero" into the fields, all of BIG5 character will be
displayed as " __ " character, and I didn't find the rules about these
fields.

Please help me to solve the questions, I sincerely hope you'll answer
the questions for me. Thank you very much!

Best Regard.

Alextwl

Subject: RE: Some questions about UNICODE.BIN file format

Dear alextwl,

Thank you for your enquiry. I should be happy to help, but please bear
in mind that it's nearly six years since I last looked at this topic.
So, what I write to you now is just my own reading of the document.

A UNICODE.BIN file may support multiple code pages. For each code page,
there is a table for converting from Unicode and another for converting
to Unicode.

The table for converting from Unicode is a set of structures whose form
is shown in Table 3. The table for converting to Unicode is a set of
structures whose form is shown in Table 4.

Each of these structures defines a range of characters for which
conversion is valid. For instance, when converting from Unicode to some
code page, suppose that only the following characters have valid
conversions:

  0000h to 0123h
  1000h to 1234h
  2000h to 2345h
  3000h to 3456h
  4000h to 4567h
  5000h to 5678h

For each of these 6 ranges, there would be a range definition, as shown
in Table 3. Let's number them as range definitions 1 to 6. The aim is to
build the links to upper and lower ranges to make a roughly balanced
tree. The following diagram shows how this would work, with lower ranges
at the top.

                               range 1
                             /
                     range 2
                   /
Table 2 -> range 3             range 4
                   \         /
                     range 5
                             \ range 6


In range 5, the field at offset 00h would show the way to range 4 and
the field at offset 02h would show the way to range 6.

But in range 2, the field at offset 00h would show the way to range 1,
but the field at offset 02h would be zero, because there is no higher
range (that will not already have been found earlier in the tree).

In range 1, both field at offsets 00h and 02h will be zero. If your
navigation of the tree gets this far and you haven't found a range that
includes the character you want to convert, then the character is
invalid (and will be converted by default to an underscore).

If you write zero into the fields, you are saying that there are no
lower or higher ranges. If you do this in the first range definition,
then the only characters you can convert to or from Unicode are the ones
covered by that first range definition.

When I wrote the document, I imagined it would be used by people to
interpret a UNICODE.BIN file that they already have, such as supplied
with Windows. If you have trouble understanding the document, you can
ask me to explain, of course, but you can also try to match its
descriptions against what you see in a real UNICODE.BIN file.

Geoff.
